# Dynamic Decision-Making: Visualising Infectious Disease Impact and Uncertainty in Manchester Using Power BI

• Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualise the impact and uncertainty of an airborne infectious disease outbreak in Manchester.

• Analysed supercomputer simulation data to assist decision-makers (e.g., emergency responders, and government officials) in resource allocation during a medical crisis.

• Processed large datasets in CSV format and utilised Python for pre-processing to ensure accurate and efficient data handling.

• Visualized infection spread based on wind conditions and environmental factors, incorporating multiple scenarios for enhanced decision-making.

• Applied data visualisation best practices, focusing on accessibility for non-technical users, including using appropriate colour scales and designs for colour-blind users.

• Delivered a single-page, interactive report in Power BI, enabling users to identify high-risk areas for targeted response quickly.

• Ensured that visual elements and interactivity aligned with a crisis's real-time, critical decision-making needs.
